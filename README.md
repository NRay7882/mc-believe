This is a small mod I worked on as part of a code jam for an intro to Java. It consists of two classes, an event handler and listener for the specific game actions needed to trigger the event. In this case, I wanted to play some custom sounds when the player was hit by a Shulker's bullet and had the levitation status effect.
